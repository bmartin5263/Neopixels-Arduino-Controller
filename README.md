# Neopixel Arduino Controller
C++ code for controlling Adafruit Neopixel LEDs

## TODO

- Support Neopixel Grid
- Try virtual methods to see if they have any performance impact
- Develop virtual testing environment that doesn't need a physical LED board to test effects
  - Need separate toolchain to support this
  - Use basic text graphics to display a LED board and its colors
